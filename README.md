# Process Scheduling Analysis

Average turn around time of scheduling algorithms(in order of FCFS,SCJ,PS and RR respectively): [27.0, 27.0, 25.0, 18.5]
Average waiting time of scheduling algorithms(in order of FCFS,SCJ,PS and RR respectively): [16.5, 16.5, 14.5, 8.0]

 Hence we can see that in this case, Round robin is the most efficient scheduling algorithm.
